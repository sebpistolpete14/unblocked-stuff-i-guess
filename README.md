bunch of html files to play on school chromebooks

just download the repository using the code button, and unzip it to a usb drive. then plug the drive into the chromebook and copy the files over to the main drive. now you can play games yay

i lowk don't care if you add more files to this
you could also fork it and make it a game site using vercel or smth else
do whatever you want ig
